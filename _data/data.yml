    summary: |
      I am on the start of my career and to make ends meet I have done several jobs.
      I was working for 3 years at a hotel in the summers between school as a waiter and after that I worked 2 years in restaurants as a waiter as well.
      In 2017 I went to Denmark to work as a translator/team coordinator when one of the people staying in the hotel offered me a job there.
      He is the owner of the company and the plan was to change all of Denmarks fluorescent lights to LED for less power consumpion.
      My job there was to translate from english to greek frotom the employers and the empoloyees.
